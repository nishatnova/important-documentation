Brevo Account Setup Guide
For Automated Email Integration
This guide explains how to create a Brevo account and share the required credentials so automated emails can be sent from your platform.

Step 1: Create a Brevo Account
Go to the official website:
👉 https://www.brevo.com
Click “Sign Up Free”
Register using:
Your business email address (from which email address you want to send emails to users from the platform)
A secure password
Verify your email address from the confirmation email sent by Brevo.
Complete your company profile information:

Step 2: Verify Your Sending Domain (Recommended)
To improve email delivery and prevent emails from going to spam:
Go to Settings → Senders & IP
Click “Domains”
Click “Add a Domain”
Enter your domain (example: yourdomain.com)
Brevo will provide DNS records (TXT, SPF, DKIM)
Add those records in your domain hosting panel (e.g., cPanel / Cloudflare / GoDaddy)
Wait until Brevo shows the domain as Verified
⚠️ If needed, please share domain hosting access so we can configure DNS properly.

Step 3: Create an SMTP Key 
We need an API key to connect your platform with Brevo.
Go to Settings
Click “SMTP & API”
Generate a New API Key
Copy the API Key immediately

Step 4: Share Required Credentials
Please securely share the following information:
✅ Brevo Account Email
✅ Generated API Key
✅ Verified Sending Email Address
✅ Confirmed Domain (if added)
✅ SMTP Server
✅ Port
✅ Login
